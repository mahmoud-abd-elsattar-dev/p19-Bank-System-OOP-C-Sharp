# 🏦 Bank Management System — C# OOP with 3-Layer Architecture

A fully object-oriented C# console application for managing bank clients, users, and transactions — built with a clean 3-layer architecture (Data Layer, Business Layer, Console) and SQL Server as the database backend.

---

## 📖 Overview

This is a C# OOP Bank Management System designed with a professional 3-layer architecture that separates data access, business logic, and presentation concerns. It replaces the previous file-based storage with a **SQL Server database**, making it a closer representation of real-world enterprise application design. A `Bank.drawio` diagram is included to visualize the database structure.

## ✨ Features

- **Login System**: Secure authentication with username and password
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Bitwise permission flags control access per feature per user
- **Client Management**: Full CRUD operations (Add, Delete, Update, Find, List)
- **User Management**: Full CRUD operations for system users
- **Transactions**: Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer between accounts, and Total Balance reporting
- **Transfer Log**: All transfer transactions recorded in the database
- **Login Log**: All login events recorded with timestamp
- **Currency Management**: View and manage currencies with exchange rates
- **Logout**: Return to login screen without exiting

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **3-Layer Architecture** — Strict separation of Data Layer, Business Layer, and Presentation Layer
- **OOP** — Full class-based design with encapsulation across all layers
- **ADO.NET** — Direct SQL Server communication using `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, `SqlDataReader`
- **SQL Server** — Relational database replacing file-based storage
- **Stored Procedures / SQL Queries** — Data operations handled via parameterized queries
- **Enums** — Permission flags and menu options
- **Bitwise Operations** — Assigning and checking user permissions
- **Static Methods** — Used in business and data layer classes for CRUD operations
- **Global State** — `CurrentUser` shared across screens for session management
- **Database Diagram** — `Bank.drawio` documents the database schema visually
